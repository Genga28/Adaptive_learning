Introduction: 
EduQuest, once a promising player in the EdTech industry, encountered challenges leading to its decline. To reignite its success, a comprehensive resurgence strategy was devised. This project delineates the methodology employed to analyze historical data, identify shortcomings, and implement innovative solutions using dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and Business Intelligence (BI) tools such as Power BI.

Aim:
 The objective is to revive EduQuest by scrutinizing historical data, implementing dynamic learning trails, time management features, and integrating gamification principles to enhance student engagement and academic performance.

Objectives:
•	Analyze historical data to discern past performance and unearth areas for enhancement.
•	Implement dynamic learning trails tailored to individual learning preferences, pacing, and proficiency levels.
•	Develop a time management feature to optimize study schedules and refine time allocation for students.
•	Infuse gamification principles to heighten student engagement and motivation.
•	Utilize quizzes to pinpoint weaker areas in students' knowledge and recommend targeted learning concepts.

System Description: 
The system amalgamates data analysis, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and Power BI to bolster decision-making. Historical data is managed using SQLite3, while Power BI is employed for visualizing insights. Dynamic learning trails, time management, and gamification features are integrated into the EduQuest platform to enrich the learning experience.

Functional Requirements:
•	Data collection, cleansing, and preprocessing.
•	Dynamic learning trail formulation based on historical data and student preferences.
•	Time management feature for optimizing study schedules.
•	Integration of gamification elements for augmented engagement.
•	Quiz functionality to identify weaker areas and recommend focused learning concepts.

Modules:
1.	Data Management
2.	Dynamic Learning Trails
3.	Time Management
4.	Gamification Integration
5.	Quiz and Assessment
